# The blocks to be obfuscated.
# For regular minecraft blocks, you can use the XMaterial enum.
# Which is listed here: https://github.com/CryptoMorin/XSeries/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryptomorin/xseries/XMaterial.java#L68
# If your server is modded and the material is not in the XMaterial, you can use the bukkit material name instead.
# For modern versions (1.13+), you can use the block registry name for more detailed specification & modded block info that isn't in XMaterial dictionary,
# Example: 'minecraft:stone_stairs[waterlogged=true]'.

# For ItemsAdder custom blocks, you can use the format 'ia:custom_block_registry_name'.
# For Oraxen custom blocks, you can use the format 'oraxen:custom_item_registry_name'.
# For Nexo custom blocks, you can use the format 'nexo:custom_item_registry_name'.
